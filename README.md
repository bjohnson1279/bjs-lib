Brent Johnson's library of javascript functions and classes

This library is a work in progress that upon completion will simplify many of the most common javascript tasks without the use of popular libraries with significant overhead.  Among these include building forms (registration in particular), building reports with sorting capabilities, XHR requests, form submission, and form field validation.
